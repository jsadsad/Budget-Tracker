# Budget Tracker

This web application is a simple budgets and expenses tracker that is useful on the go whether it be for travel, groceries, or shopping. Simply create a budget with a max amount, and accordingly add expenses to the budget which will indicate how close you are to your desired maximum.

Budget Tracker is built as a single-page-application using `React Hooks` and styled with `react-bootstrap` keeping accessibility in mind.
